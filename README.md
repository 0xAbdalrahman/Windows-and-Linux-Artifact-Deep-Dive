# Windows and Linux Artifact Deep Dive
## DEPI Graduation Project - Digital Forensics Track

This project is part of a graduation requirement and focuses on a deep forensic analysis of Windows and Linux operating system artifacts. 
It explores memory forensics, file system analysis, log examination, and cross-platform evidence comparison.

## Project Purpose
To understand how different operating systems generate, store, and preserve forensic artifacts, and to build a unified investigation methodology for both environments.

## Project Timeline
### Week 1 – Windows Forensics

- Acquire memory using FTK Imager / Volatility.

- Analyze Registry, Jump Lists, and Shellbags.

- Extract browser history & cache.


### Week 2 – Linux Forensics

- Analyze EXT4 partitions using Sleuth Kit.

- Recover deleted Bash history & examine logs.

- Perform RAM acquisition using LiME.


### Week 3 – Comparative Forensics

- Compare Windows vs Linux artifacts.

- Analyze timestamp formats, encodings, and user activity trails.

- Evaluate tool compatibility.


### Week 4 – Final Consolidation

- Produce a unified Windows/Linux forensic guide.

- Discuss legal considerations & evidence handling.
